CPP Module 01 - 42 School
Overview

This project is part of the C++ Modules at 42 School, focusing on object-oriented programming concepts such as memory allocation, references, and more. The goal is to strengthen understanding of C++ fundamentals while following the 42 coding standards.
Topics Covered

    Pointers and References
    Memory Allocation (new / delete)
    std::string Usage
    Function Overloading
    Namespaces

Installation & Compilation

    Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/cpp-module-01.git
cd cpp-module-01

Compile the project:

make

or, if there is no Makefile:
